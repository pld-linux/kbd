- fixed install patch: removed stripping
- moved /usr/share/kbd/* to /usr/share (for compatibility with console-*)
- added kbdrate.8.pl (removed from util-linux)
- added lat2u-16 font (and optional sfm) from console-data; use it by default
  (lat2-16 from kbd has frames which doesn't display correctly in VGA text mode,
   lat2a-16 has non-unicode translation table)
- removed BuildReq gzip (required by rpm-build - to build almost all packages)
- removed ldconfig from post/postun - kbd doesn't provide any libraries
- release 2
  Still no fallback table support :(
